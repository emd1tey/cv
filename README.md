# Project Overview

This repository contains a FastAPI application that serves a CV (Curriculum Vitae) in both HTML and PDF formats. The project also calculates the distances between major cities in Poland and two reference cities: Krakow and Gdansk. The application is deployed using GitHub Actions to GitHub Pages.

## Project Structure

- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: GitHub Actions workflow for deploying the CV to GitHub Pages.
- `main.py`: The main FastAPI application file.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Docker Compose configuration for running the application.
- `docker-compose.debug.yml`: Docker Compose configuration for debugging the application.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies required for the project.
- `mkdocs.yml`: Configuration file for MkDocs, used to generate project documentation.
- `static/`: Directory for static files such as the generated HTML and PDF CV.
- `site/`: Directory where MkDocs will generate the static site.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Python 3.12
- Git

### Running the Application

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
    cd yourrepository
    ```

2. Build and start the application using Docker Compose:
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:80`.

### Debugging the Application

1. Start the application in debug mode:
    ```sh
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.debug.yml up --build
    ```

2. Connect your debugger to `localhost:5678`.

### Generating the CV

1. Ensure `docs/cv.md` contains your CV in Markdown format.

2. Convert the Markdown CV to HTML and PDF:
    ```sh
    python main.py --convert
    ```

## Routes

- `/distances`: API endpoint to get the distances between major Polish cities and Krakow/Gdansk.
- `/osm`: Serves static files related to the CV in HTML format.
- `/wiki`: Serves static files generated by MkDocs.

## To-Do List

- [ ] Add more cities to the `/distances` endpoint.
- [ ] Improve the styling of the generated HTML CV.
- [ ] Add unit tests for the FastAPI application.
- [ ] Implement caching for geolocation queries.
- [ ] Automate PDF generation upon Markdown updates.

## About

This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a FastAPI application that integrates with various tools such as GitHub Actions, Docker, and MkDocs. It includes an example of serving static files, converting Markdown to HTML and PDF, and calculating geodesic distances using external APIs.
